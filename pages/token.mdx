## Generating a token

Go to https://studio.themetavoice.xyz, and on the dropdown menu in the top right, look for the "Developers" button.

Once you have the modal open, you can either generate your first token or copy the one available.

<Warning>Generating a new token invalidates the previous one! This is a security feature in case your token leaks.</Warning>

### Understanding tokens

Your token is a [JWT](https://jwt.io) signed by our servers, and validated to be the latest by our backend.

They are linked directly to your account, and will take usage time from it. That means you can get more minutes per month by upgrading plan or contacting us for extra credits.

You may share the token with others within your organization, but credits will be pulled from the account they were generated from.

You can see when your credits are expected to renew on https://studio.themetavoice.xyz/plans
