### What are targets?

They refer to the voice id to use for conversion. Common ones are `"eva"` and `"zeus"`.

### How do I use them?

You can get the voice id by clicking on the clipboard icon at the top right of any card, then use that as the `X-Target: <paste>` header, e.g. `X-Target: eva`

You can find the copy voice id button here:

<Info>
Don't see the clipboard icon?

Make sure the "Show copy id button" checkbox is ticked in the "Developers" menu, accessible in the dropdown on the top right of the page:
