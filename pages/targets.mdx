### What are targets?

They refer to the voice card you would use in the web UI. Common ones are `"eva"` and `"zeus"`.

### How do I use them?

For curated and experimental targets, granted you have access to them, you simply look at the name of the target, lowercase it, and use it as the value for the `X-Target` header.

E.g. if you want to convert using the "Zeus" voice, you lowercase it to `"zeus"`, and set it in the header: `X-Target: zeus`

### Which voices are available to me?

Any of the ones you are able to convert when signed into the web UI.

### What about voices that are not curated or experimental?

If you have access to other voices, there is a way to convert them. In general, the easiest option is to open the network tab in your browser's devtools, performing the conversion using the card you're looking for, and checking the headers of the relevant `POST` request
